  <div class="content">

    <p>
      The <strong>Supreme Court of India</strong> has put on hold its November 20 ruling that
      limited the definition of the <strong>Aravalli range</strong> to landforms rising
      more than <strong>100 metres</strong> above the surrounding terrain. The court has
      decided to reopen the matter for a comprehensive review.
    </p>

    <p>
      A bench led by <strong>Chief Justice of India Surya Kant</strong>, along with
      Justices <strong>J.K. Maheshwari</strong> and <strong>A.G. Masih</strong>, placed the
      earlier judgment “in abeyance” and indicated the need for expert inputs to ensure a
      balanced and scientifically sound approach.
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      The court proposed the formation of a high-level expert committee to study ecological
      continuity, assess the scientific basis of the height-based definition, and examine
      the regulation of mining activities across the Aravalli region.
    </div>

    <p>
      The issue was taken up <strong>suo motu</strong> on December 27 after the earlier
      ruling attracted criticism from environmental experts and stakeholders. During the
      hearing, the bench observed that an independent and impartial expert opinion was
      essential to address unresolved concerns.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Solicitor General Tushar Mehta</strong>, appearing for the Union government,
      welcomed the court’s intervention and noted that several misunderstandings had
      emerged following the November order. He pointed out that the ruling had relied on a
      court-appointed expert report and had envisaged a detailed mining plan subject to
      Supreme Court approval.
    </p>

    <p>
      The bench expressed concern that restricting the Aravallis to elevations above
      100 metres could reduce protected areas and create regulatory gaps. It questioned
      how mining would be governed in zones lying between qualifying hill formations,
      warning that such an approach could fragment a continuous ecological system.
    </p>

    <p>
      Emphasising the need to preserve the geological and ecological integrity of the
      ancient mountain range, the court suggested that a broader environmental assessment
      may be necessary to avoid weakening existing safeguards.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the request of the Solicitor General, the court directed the Union government to
      submit its response before finalising the composition of the expert committee.
      Notices have been issued to the Centre, concerned states and the amicus curiae.
      The matter will be heard next on <strong>January 21, 2026</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The interim stay is expected to pause the mapping and delineation exercise initiated
      by the Union environment ministry and state governments, which was based on the
      now-suspended elevation criterion.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stretching over <strong>700 kilometres</strong> from Gujarat to Delhi through
      Rajasthan and Haryana, the <strong>Aravalli range</strong> plays a crucial role in
      preventing desertification, replenishing groundwater and sustaining biodiversity
      across northern and western India.
